@article{Barlow_1999,
 abstract = {Nitric oxide (NO) levels in turbulent flames are sensitive to temperature, O atom concentrations, and residence times at the NO forming conditions. Consequently, accurate prediction of NO formation is a challenge for turbulent combustion models, and NO is a useful scalar to consider when evaluating turbulence-chemistry submodels. Predictions of NO formation in a series of hydrogen flames with varying levels of helium dilution are compared with experimental results. Dilution reduces flame radiation to the point where uncertainties in the radiation calculation have only a small influence on NO emission, and this allows different models for the coupling of turbulence and chemistry to be compared in relative isolation from the effects of radiation. Calculations using the Probability Density Function (PDF) method and the Conditional Moment Closure (CMC) method are carried out using the same turbulence model, radiation model, reduced chemical mechanism, and boundary conditions, so that similarities and differences between these two approaches for the coupling of turbulence and chemistry may be isolated and more fully understood. To accomplish this, flow model constants are adjusted to match measured axial profiles of mean velocity and mixture fraction in the undiluted flame, before detailed scalar comparisons are carried out. The optically thin radiation assumption is shown to be appropriate for these hydrogen flames, and the effects of flame radiation on NO emission are examined. The sensitivities of the calculated results to certain boundary conditions and submodels are also quantified. Both turbulence-chemistry models yield good results for conditional mean temperature and H2O mole fraction. Results also show that both models yield quantitatively useful predictions for the NO formation and emission. With all other submodels being the same, the PDF method predicts lower NO levels than does the CMC method. This difference is associated with lower O atom concentrations predicted by the PDF method. Both methods underpredict NO formation in the lower portion of the jet flames. This deficiency is attributed to the effects of differential diffusion, which are not included in the models, and to the influence of heat release on turbulence structure near the flame base.},

 abstract = {Measurements of temperature, the major species (N2,O2,CH4,CO2,H2O, CO, and H2), OH, and NO are obtained in steady laminar opposed-flow partially premixed flames of methane and air, using the non-intrusive techniques of Raman scattering and laser-induced fluorescence. Flames having fuel-side equivalence ratios of ␾⫽ 3.17, 2.17, and 1.8 are stabilized on a porous cylindrical burner (Tsuji burner) in a low-velocity flow of air. Results are compared with calculations using a version of the Sandia laminar flame code that is formulated for the Tsuji geometry and includes an optically thin treatment of radiation. Because velocity profiles are not measured, the strain rate in each calculation is adjusted to match the measured profile of the mixture fraction. Measured profiles of temperature and species mass fractions are then compared with results of calculations using the GRI-Mech 2.11 and 3.0 chemical mechanisms, as well as a detailed mechanism from Miller. All three mechanisms give agreement with experimental results for the major species that is generally within experimental uncertainty. With regard to NO formation, the relative performance of the three mechanisms depends on the fuel-side equivalence ratio. GRI-Mech 2.11 gives reasonably good agreement with measured NO levels in lean and near-stoichiometric conditions, but it under predicts NO levels in fuel-rich conditions. GRI-Mech 3.0 significantly over predicts the peak NO levels the ␾ ⫽ 3.17 and 2.17 flames, but it yields relatively good agreement with measurements in the ␾ ⫽ 1.8 flame. The Miller mechanism gives good agreement with measured NO levels in the ␾ ⫽ 3.17 flame, but it progressively over predicts peak NO levels in the leaner flames. Comparisons of adiabatic and radiative calculations show that radiation can have a significant effect on the width and structure of partially premixed flames, as well as on the levels of NO produced.},

@article{Bordbar_2020,
 abstract = {All published weighted sum of gray gases models (WSGGM) were either developed for a limited number of molar fraction ratios, MR, or include MR as a variable in their formulations. Either way, they are not able to adequately support moisture-rich regions of combustion environments, such as the outer regions of unwanted fires, fires during water-based suppression, and some air-injection regions of furnaces. In this article, we provide an extension to a previously published WSGGM by coupling it to a new accurate set of WSGGM coefficients for pure carbon dioxide and water vapor. The coupling follows a linear interpolation methodology, which is justified by a detailed analysis of the line-by-line (LBL) absorption spectra and by plotting the total emissivity of CO2~--~H2O mixtures with large and small values of MR for various temperatures and path lengths. The proposed model is discussed and validated in four benchmarks, using a solution obtained by LBL integration as reference. The results indicate that, while the previously available WSGGMs either have excessive computational costs or yield inaccurate results in the regions of large MR, the new model can be safely used for all gas compositions in a computationally efficient manner.},

 abstract = {Thermal radiation is an important heat transfer mode in many combustion systems. This article addresses experimental and computational works on radiative transfer in these systems. Attention is restricted to works where thermal radiation was accurately measured or simulated. The effects of radiative transfer in laminar flames and a few works where these effects were investigated are discussed first. Then, turbulent free flames are addressed. The importance of non-gray models for reliable prediction of thermal radiation, especially in nonluminous gaseous flames, is emphasized. The interaction between turbulence and radiation is also highlighted. Confined turbulent flames in laboratory combustion chambers are addressed next, beginning with gaseous flames and then discussing radiative transfer in liquid spray and coal flames. Finally, industrial applications are considered, namely, gas turbine combustors, industrial furnaces, and utility boilers, and a brief reference to other applications is made. A few general conclusions are summarized in the last section.},

 abstract = {Abstract Abstract-Measurements of the polarized components of the reflectivity of a compressed propane soot pellet are presented which demonstrate that, for wavelengths in the infrared, the reflection is specular and is described by the Fresnel equations. By matching these equations to the full angular variations of the specular reflectivities, an effective refractive index of the soot/air mixture is determined at each wavelength. To deduce the refractive indices of the particles themselves, theories for the optical properties of composites are considered and a new relationship based upon the effective medium theory is introduced. The void fraction near the surface of the pellet must be known. A technique is presented for measuring this voidage by performing image analyses of scanning electronmicrographs of the pellet surface. This value of void is found to be substantially less than the bulk void. The inferred indices of the particles are seen to be sensitiveto the value of the void fraction but somewhat insensitive to the particular theory adopted for the optical properties of the soot/air mixture.},
