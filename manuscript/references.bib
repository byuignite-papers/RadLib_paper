 abstract = {Measurements of temperature, the major species (N2,O2,CH4,CO2,H2O, CO, and H2), OH, and NO are obtained in steady laminar opposed-flow partially premixed flames of methane and air, using the non-intrusive techniques of Raman scattering and laser-induced fluorescence. Flames having fuel-side equivalence ratios of ␾⫽ 3.17, 2.17, and 1.8 are stabilized on a porous cylindrical burner (Tsuji burner) in a low-velocity flow of air. Results are compared with calculations using a version of the Sandia laminar flame code that is formulated for the Tsuji geometry and includes an optically thin treatment of radiation. Because velocity profiles are not measured, the strain rate in each calculation is adjusted to match the measured profile of the mixture fraction. Measured profiles of temperature and species mass fractions are then compared with results of calculations using the GRI-Mech 2.11 and 3.0 chemical mechanisms, as well as a detailed mechanism from Miller. All three mechanisms give agreement with experimental results for the major species that is generally within experimental uncertainty. With regard to NO formation, the relative performance of the three mechanisms depends on the fuel-side equivalence ratio. GRI-Mech 2.11 gives reasonably good agreement with measured NO levels in lean and near-stoichiometric conditions, but it under predicts NO levels in fuel-rich conditions. GRI-Mech 3.0 significantly over predicts the peak NO levels the ␾ ⫽ 3.17 and 2.17 flames, but it yields relatively good agreement with measurements in the ␾ ⫽ 1.8 flame. The Miller mechanism gives good agreement with measured NO levels in the ␾ ⫽ 3.17 flame, but it progressively over predicts peak NO levels in the leaner flames. Comparisons of adiabatic and radiative calculations show that radiation can have a significant effect on the width and structure of partially premixed flames, as well as on the levels of NO produced.},

@article{Bordbar_2020,
 abstract = {All published weighted sum of gray gases models (WSGGM) were either developed for a limited number of molar fraction ratios, MR, or include MR as a variable in their formulations. Either way, they are not able to adequately support moisture-rich regions of combustion environments, such as the outer regions of unwanted fires, fires during water-based suppression, and some air-injection regions of furnaces. In this article, we provide an extension to a previously published WSGGM by coupling it to a new accurate set of WSGGM coefficients for pure carbon dioxide and water vapor. The coupling follows a linear interpolation methodology, which is justified by a detailed analysis of the line-by-line (LBL) absorption spectra and by plotting the total emissivity of CO2~--~H2O mixtures with large and small values of MR for various temperatures and path lengths. The proposed model is discussed and validated in four benchmarks, using a solution obtained by LBL integration as reference. The results indicate that, while the previously available WSGGMs either have excessive computational costs or yield inaccurate results in the regions of large MR, the new model can be safely used for all gas compositions in a computationally efficient manner.},
